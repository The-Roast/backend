		"body": "<p>In Maharashtra, India, Hindu nationalist groups are using social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp to target Muslims. The online crusade has led to the arrest and harassment of Muslims for seemingly innocuous posts. The groups are spinning any content, no matter how tenuous, as offensive to Hindus. This reflects the Hindu nationalist slant of politics under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. The tensions stem from the use of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb as a symbol of protest for Muslim youth in Maharashtra, which has created a Hindu versus Muslim binary. The BJP, accused of stoking religious tensions, renamed the city of Aurangabad to Sambhaji Nagar in 2023, further fueling the divide.</p>"

He argues that English politics is equally as ugly as Vox in Spain, highlighting attacks on women, the poor, and unions, as well as the issue of identity politics <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/17/only-by-listening-to-voters-priorities-can-parties-defeat-the-far-right>(The Guardian)</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Labour's Focus on Voter Priorities: Dr David Mathieson, former special adviser to Robin Cook, agrees with Gordon Brown's article on Spanish politics and the attack on the far-right party Vox.

He mentions the two-child benefit cap as an example and criticizes Liz Truss for irresponsible spending. Starmer emphasizes the importance of not repeating the same mistakes and ensuring control of the economy <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/18/met-chief-mark-rowley-rishi-sunak-time-davie-bbc-keir-starmer-politics-live>(The Guardian)</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tony Blair and Keir Starmer Q&A: The Q&A session between Tony Blair and Keir Starmer at the Future of Britain conference is described as a fascinating insight into Labour politics. While they did not disagree on much, there was an underlying sense of hierarchy and respect between the two leaders. Blair passes the baton to Starmer as a worthy successor <a href=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2023/jul/18/met-chief-mark-rowley-rishi-sunak-time-davie-bbc-keir-starmer-politics-live>(The Guardian)</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legal Action Against Railway Station Ticket Office Closures: Labour mayors, led by Andy Burnham, are launching legal action to prevent the closure of railway station ticket offices across England.

Government sources indicate that planning for a reshuffle is underway to reset the narrative if the Conservatives lose three byelections.

		"title": "The Uncertain Future of the Commonwealth Games",
		"body": "<p>The Australian state of Victoria has announced that it will not host the 2026 Commonwealth Games due to cost concerns. The decision has left the future of the Games in doubt, as finding a new host with less than three years to go is a challenging task. The cost of hosting the Games had grown beyond expectations, with estimates ranging from $6 billion to $7 billion, far exceeding the initial budget of $2.6 billion. The Victoria government had faced questions about funding, and a dispute with the federal government over financial support further complicated matters. The sudden cancellation of the Games is just the latest setback for the Commonwealth Games, which has struggled to find hosts and maintain relevance in recent years. The Games, originally known as the British Empire Games, have faced criticism for their colonial origins and their failure to attract younger audiences. Additionally, the Games have been criticized for taking place in countries that criminalize same-sex relations, with seven Commonwealth nations imposing life imprisonment for homosexuality. The Commonwealth Games Federation recognizes the need for adaptation and modernization to remain relevant, but finding a new host for 2026 and securing a host for the centenary in 2030 will be challenging tasks for the organization.</p>"

		"title": "Europe's Heatwave and the Urgency for Climate Action",
		"body": "<p>The recent heatwaves in Europe, named Cerberus and Charon, have highlighted the urgent need for climate action. The extreme heat, wildfires, and floods in various countries across the northern hemisphere are a clear indication of the dangerous impact of global heating. While an emerging El Niño weather pattern is contributing to the rising temperatures, the underlying cause is the planet's already warmer state due to greenhouse gas emissions. As the Earth gets hotter, the risk of feedback loops and unforeseen events increases. Europe is currently experiencing uncharted territory, with high pressure systems and heat domes trapping the region under scorching temperatures. Scientists warn that global temperatures could soon breach the critical 1.5C threshold set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The consequences of extreme weather events, such as loss of life, mass migration, crop losses, and soaring food prices, are already being felt. However, European politics is showing signs of drift, with the aftermath of the pandemic, conflicts, energy crises, and economic recession diverting attention from net zero targets. The green agenda has become a battleground for culture wars, hindering progress in reaching climate neutrality. It is crucial for progressive politicians to rediscover their convictions and act with urgency before it's too late.</p>"

The platform, called Common Sense, focuses on common-sense policies for a centrist White House and aims to appeal to moderate voters. The organization's co-chair, Larry Hogan, spoke about the platform's goals and addressed concerns that a third-party candidate could split the vote and benefit Donald Trump. While the path to success may be challenging, Hogan believes that the current political climate, with a significant number of voters dissatisfied with both major parties, presents an opportunity for a third alternative. The platform covers a range of topics, including immigration, gun control, and abortion, and aims to find consensus on key issues. While some policies have been previously attempted and failed, Hogan believes that the unique circumstances and frustration with the status quo make it worth pursuing a different approach. The ultimate goal for No Labels is not to be a spoiler but to provide an alternative for voters who are dissatisfied with the major party candidates.</p>"

These pixels, commonly embedded in websites for advertising purposes, allow the tech companies to collect information about user behavior. The data accessed by the tech companies includes details about users' incomes, tax refunds, and government program enrollment. While Meta has admitted to using the data for targeted ads and AI training, it remains unclear how Google utilized the information. The findings have sparked concerns about privacy risks and potential legal consequences for both tax prep and tech companies.

		"title": "The Fallout of Election Denialism in Tarrant County",
		"body": "<p>Heider Garcia, the former elections administrator for Tarrant County, Texas, faced death threats and false conspiracy theories about the 2020 election after the county broke its Republican voting patterns for Joe Biden. Despite the attacks, Garcia championed transparency and engaged with skeptics, but ultimately resigned due to differences with a Republican county judge who catered to election deniers. The judge helped set up a taskforce focused on investigating and prosecuting election crimes, which critics view as contributing to an anxious climate around elections. Tarrant County exemplifies the fallout of the election denialism movement, with Democrats asking the US justice department to intervene to protect voters of color from intimidation. The hiring process to replace Garcia included a candidate who went to a voter's home to deliver a letter questioning their choice of polling place. Garcia stated that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, but there is still a quest to find a villain. Conservative officials who entertain Trump's falsehoods about the 2020 election have raised alarms about voter fraud, despite a lack of evidence. Tarrant County, with its diverse population, highlights the impact of this movement in one of the most populous counties in the country. The taskforce established in Tarrant County to handle election fraud complaints has yet to report any filed cases, leading critics to view it as a publicity stunt. Democrats argue that the taskforce is part of a larger Republican strategy to undermine confidence in elections. The climate created by the taskforce has made it more difficult to recruit election workers and has heightened concerns about making mistakes. The resignation of Heider Garcia, along with the taskforce, has prompted Democrats to request an investigation from the US justice department. The hiring process to replace Garcia included partisan candidates, raising concerns about the non-partisan nature of election administration. Despite the challenges faced by election administrators, they are crucial in upholding democracy and ensuring fair elections. The Brennan Center for Justice found that 30% of local election officials have been abused, harassed, or threatened in their roles. The taskforce in Tarrant County adds to the difficulty of being an election administrator and has contributed to an anxious environment. Overall, the fallout of election denialism in Tarrant County highlights the need for transparency, the protection of voters' rights, and the non-partisan nature of election administration.</p>"
